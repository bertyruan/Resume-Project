I've accomplished all but the last one, and here is my proof. I've created one that I am proud of because in the past while I was working on Ruby on Rails, I've always looked down upon my ability, deplored myself and mentally beat my morale down. Despite my work and my production, I didn't believe that I was creating genuine work. Here is <a href='http://resumebr.herokuapp.com/'> my website </a> if you want to take a look. In hindsight, it didn't turn out too bad. It may have caused my rejection from PLA (since I spent more time designing the website than perfecting my resume), but it was a milestone. However, I didn't believe so and that experience would prove to be the last one for awhile. Looking back on the github commits, it was March 24, 2014. Now it's June 24, 2015. So an entire 15 months since! Down to the exact date. What a happy coincidence that I am blogging about this. It seems that fate is playing with me with mirth and muse. In contrast with my previous work, <a href='bertyruan.github.io'> my current website </a> is bland and unembellished with css and javascript. The reason being is that I want to start small and then slowly but surely add new features, cool awesome sexy features nonetheless, until it become a robust website and has the potential to have a server backing up it's data! I want this website coding experience to be not only a mean to learn web development and other cool stuff such as designing HTML5 games, but also a mean to empower myself as a coder and software developer. I have already taken my first step. This blog post is also a first step towards my introspective tendencies in formulating and recording down my thoughts. Note that this blogging exercise is indispensable from my coding aspirations. For I need a blog to have content to post on my blogging website! Thus in the future, I plan to blog frequently and to also experiment on different web formatting techniques to pretty-fy my site. In the meantime, <span>adieu</span>.</p>"
